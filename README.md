## Key Similarities

### Common Core Features
All implementations share these fundamental capabilities:
- **Cross-browser support**: Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit
- **Auto-waiting**: Elements are automatically waited for before actions
- **Network interception**: Ability to mock and monitor network requests
- **Mobile device emulation**: Simulate mobile devices and touch events
- **Geolocation**: Mock geolocation for testing location-based features
- **Screenshots and PDFs**: Capture visual content
- **File handling**: Upload and download files
- **JavaScript execution**: Run custom JavaScript in browser context

### Architecture Similarities
- All use the same underlying Playwright Node.js runtime
- Communication via RPC/stdio with the Node.js Playwright process
- Browser patches are identical across all implementations
- Same browser installation and management system

## Key Differences

### 1. **Purpose and Target Audience**
- **playwright**: Web developers and QA engineers doing E2E testing
- **playwright-go**: Go developers needing browser automation
- **playwright-python**: Python developers and data scientists
- **playwright-mcp**: AI/ML engineers integrating with LLMs

### 2. **API Design Philosophy**
- **playwright**: Promise-based, test-focused API with rich assertions
- **playwright-go**: Go idioms with error returns, struct-based configuration
- **playwright-python**: Pythonic with both sync/async variants
- **playwright-mcp**: Tool-based API designed for AI agents

### 3. **Installation and Setup**
- **playwright**: `npm init playwright@latest` (includes config setup)
- **playwright-go**: `go get` + separate browser installation
- **playwright-python**: `pip install playwright` + `playwright install`
- **playwright-mcp**: `npx @playwright/mcp@latest` (AI client integration)

### 4. **Configuration Approach**

## Getting Started

Each implementation has its own setup process. See the individual architecture documentation files above for detailed setup and usage instructions for each variant.

## Cross-Implementation Considerations

### Browser Version Synchronization
Different implementations may use slightly different browser versions. For consistent testing across implementations, consider:
- Using the same Playwright version where possible
- Testing critical flows across multiple implementations
- Understanding browser feature differences between versions

### Performance Characteristics
- **playwright**: Fastest for TypeScript/JavaScript environments
- **playwright-go**: Good performance with Go's concurrency
- **playwright-python**: May be slower due to Python overhead
- **playwright-mcp**: Performance depends on AI client integration

### Maintenance and Updates
- **playwright**: Most frequently updated (official core)
- **playwright-python**: Regular updates (official)
- **playwright-mcp**: Regular updates (official)
- **playwright-go**: Community-maintained, may lag behind core releases
